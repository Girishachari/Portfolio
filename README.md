# Portfolio
This is my first web development project, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my skills, projects, and journey as a developer. The website serves as my online resume and portfolio, helping recruiters and collaborators get to know me better.
The website includes several key sections such as an About Me page, a Projects gallery with links to live demos and GitHub repositories, a downloadable resume, and a contact form with social media integration. It is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless viewing experience across devices including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
